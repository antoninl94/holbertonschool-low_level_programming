## Overview

The exercises and projects in this repository help to gain practical experience with low-level programming. Key topics include:

- **C Programming**: Writing efficient, low-level code in C.
- **Memory Management**: Understanding how memory works and learning to use pointers.
- **Bit Manipulation**: Understanding how to work with bits and performing bitwise operations.
- **Data Structures**: Implementing various data structures from scratch.
- **System Programming**: Interfacing directly with system calls and understanding low-level system behavior.

By completing these projects, I developed a deep understanding of how software interacts with hardware and the operating system.

## Projects

This repository includes the following projects:

- **[0x00-hello_world](./0x00-hello_world)**: Introduction to the C programming language, compiling, and basic output.
- **[0x01-variables_if_else_while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while)**: Using variables, conditionals, and loops in C.
- **[0x02-functions_nested_loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops)**: Functions, loops, and nested loops in C.
- **[0x03-debugging](./0x03-debugging)**: Debugging C programs to fix errors.
- **[0x04-more_functions_nested_loops](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops)**: More advanced exercises on functions and loops.
- **[0x05-pointers_arrays_strings](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)**: Working with pointers, arrays, and strings.
- **[0x06-pointers_arrays_strings](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings)**: Additional exercises with pointers, arrays, and strings.
- **[0x07-everything_is_a_pointer](./0x07-everything_is_a_pointer)**: Learning more about pointers and how C uses them.
- **[0x08-recursion](./0x08-recursion)**: Understanding recursion and solving problems recursively.
- **[0x09-static_libraries](./0x09-static_libraries)**: Static libraries and linking in C.
- **[0x0A-argc_argv](./0x0A-argc_argv)**: Command-line arguments and understanding how programs accept input.
- **[0x0B-malloc_free](./0x0B-malloc_free)**: Dynamic memory allocation and freeing memory in C.
- **[0x0C-more_malloc_free](./0x0C-more_malloc_free)**: Advanced exercises in memory management.

Each project folder contains source code, documentation, and test files to help you implement the required solutions.

## Technologies Used

- **C Programming**: All exercises and projects are written in C.
- **GNU Make**: Some projects utilize `make` to automate the build process.
- **Git**: Version control system used for managing code changes.
- **Linux/Unix**: Most projects are designed to work in a Linux/Unix environment.
